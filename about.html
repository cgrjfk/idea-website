                        Today is an excellent day for small improvements. Whatever is working for you, find a way to improve it just a little. There’s no need to make a huge change, just a small one, something you can do right now.

                        If you called just one additional customer each day, over the course of the next month you would talk to about 20 new people. If you learned just one more new word each day, in the next year you would increase your vocabulary by more than 300 words.

                        In a marathon race, each step the winner takes is just a little bit longer and a little bit faster than each stride taken by the 100th place finisher. Yet over the course of the race, that small difference adds up in a big way.

                        Sometimes we think of dreams as fantasies - it's easy to do when you have money, rent, and work. But you can't prepare yourself and jump off the cliff: you should grow your wings first. A little bit toward the dream. Step by step. Take a step forward. After all, it's your mission.

                        If you could choose a kind of world to live in, what kind of world would you choose? If you could decide what would happen tomorrow, with what kinds of things would you fill it?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you had the power to decide what types of opportunities would come your way, what opportunities would you select? If you knew that your experiences would match your expectations, what would your expectations be?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In fact, you do have the power to choose your own way. You do have the ability to decide what kinds of events, experiences, opportunities and circumstances come your way.

                        The universe is filled with endless possibilities, and those possibilities keep growing with every minute. The way you live determines which of those possibilities will come into your life.

                      <p>
                        With your thoughts, your actions, your values, your dreams and expectations, you choose what kind of world you live in. The way you live is closely mirrored in the world you see.

                          Only when you understand the true meaning of life can you live truly. Bittersweet as life is, it's still wonderful, and it's fascinating even in tragedy. If you're just alive, try harder and try to live wonderfully

                            No one can help others as much as you do. No one can express himself like you. No one can express what you want to convey. No one can comfort others in your own way. No one can be as understanding as you are. No one can feel happy, carefree, and no one can smile as much as you do. In a word, no one can show your features to anyone else.

                          Keep faith and hope for the future. Make your most sincere dreams, and when the opportunities come, they will fight for them. It may take a season or more, but the ending will not change. Ambition, best, become a reality. An uncertain future, only one step at a time, the hope can realize the dream of the highest. We must treasure the dream, to protect it a season, let it in the heart quietly germinal. However, we have to gently protect our hearts deep expectations, slowly dream, will achieve new life.

                          That person may have enough to spread around. But if you really have to wait for someone to bring you the sun and give you a good feeling, then you may have to wait a long time.
